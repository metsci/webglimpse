# Web Glimpse

Webglimpse is a data visualization library for the web.


## WebGL

Webglimpse uses WebGL for rendering, which allows smoothly interactive visualizations even for large datasets.

WebGL is supported in Chrome, Firefox, and IE11. Support in Safari is experimental, and doesn't seem quite usable yet.


## TypeScript

Webglimpse is written in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), an open-source language that compiles to Javascript, and feels very much like Javascript. Typescript provides static type checking, which we feel will help keep our codebase manageable as it grows.

Webglimpse can be used as if it were a pure Javascript library – you don’t have to know anything about Typescript unless you want to.
